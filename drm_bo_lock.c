/*
 * This file implements a simple replacement for the buffer manager use
 * of the heavyweight hardware lock.
 * The lock is a read-write lock. Taking it in read mode is fast, and
 * intended for in-kernel use only.
 * Taking it in write mode is slow.
 *
 * The write mode is used only when there is a need to block all
 * user-space processes from allocating a
 * new memory area.
 * Typical use in write mode is X server VT switching, and it's allowed
 * to leave kernel space with the write lock held. If a user-space process
 * dies while having the write-lock, it will be released during the file
 * descriptor release.
 *
 * The read lock is typically placed at the start of an IOCTL- or
 * user-space callable function that may end up allocating a memory area.
 * This includes setstatus, super-ioctls and no_pfn; the latter may move
 * unmappable regions to mappable. It's a bug to leave kernel space with the
 * read lock held.
 *
 * Both read- and write lock taking may be interruptible for low signal-delivery
 * latency. The locking functions will return -EAGAIN if interrupted by a
 * signal.
 *
 * Locking order: The lock should be taken BEFORE any kernel mutexes
 * or spinlocks.
